# get-SHA-1-hash-of-file
ask the user for the file name and store it in a variable search for the file using the `os` module
Once we have a valid file name, we can call the read_file() function to read the contents of the file 
calculate the SHA-1 hash of the file contents Encode the file contents using the specified character set 
Hash the encoded file contents print the SHA-1 hash of the file
